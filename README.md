# Ukulele Tuner
This project was a good way to experiment with the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), to produce sounds at different pitches according to standard ukulele tuning. It was also a (very basic) investigation into Vue.js, following on from [this tutorial](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-fundamentals).

The tuner can be found [here](https://katehoward10.github.io/ukulele-tuner/).
